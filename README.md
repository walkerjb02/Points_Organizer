# Points_Organizer
I recently became President of Accounting Society. For the club, we have a series of point categories for which you receive points when you attend events. At the events, you receive those points by filling out a google form. I wanted to automate the process of updating those points with this program. Once it is finished, (it's almost done) it will be a separate executable that has a GUI that allows you to create forms which automatically update point categories.

Background GUI images will load properly once separate executable has been made. Final output is a Google Sheet with point totals in each category for everyone in Accounting Society or whichever org you use it for!
